It's a book library API where You’d use GET for getting all books or 
getting only one book by id. With the POST method, you can add a new book 
to the list. You’d need the PUT method for updating the existing book, 
and with the DELETE method, you will remove the book from the list. 
For this kind of application, I didn't use a database, I used a JSON file to store data.
