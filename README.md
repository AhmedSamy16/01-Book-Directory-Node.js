# 01-Book-Directory-Node.js

This is project 1/50 of my Node.js projects series. It's a books library API.

GET / => Will return all books.

POST / => Will create a book and save it.

GET /:id => Will return the book that match that specific id.

PUT /:id => Will update all the information about this book.

DELETE /:id => Will delete that book with that id.


For this application, I didn't use a database, I used a JSON file to store data.
